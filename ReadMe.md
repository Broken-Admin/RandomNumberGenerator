## Designed in C++ this is a simple, base library RNG
#### It is meant as a solution to a problem of pre-seeded RNG, as it generates from a limited list of possible numbers, this is, in hopes, a program that will generate a larger list of randomized numbers. There is a version that includes zero in the RNG and a version the does not include zero in this repository.
##### Please use this for any C++ projects that use large amounts of RNG, just be sure to include credit please!
